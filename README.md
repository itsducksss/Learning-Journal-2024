Created a repository (this one), and tried the github.dev edit opition, but had trouble opening the file.

Had a lesson trying to make our own tutorial. Mainly investigated the different possiblities on how to make a dialouge system and how they differ from one another e.g. interactable, click and scroll (multiple options of dialouge). Quickly implemented character movement and got the character to interact with another object to print the phrase "Dialouge started!", which was successful, had small issue I resolved in which the Tag in the script differed from that for the playable character which led to the print command not applying and working. The other script I followed had a minor issue that while did not affect gameplay may be affected in the future, as it stated that it had trouble as it was unsure if there were hidden flies for the different strings, will finish this and see if applicable to fuse both options to create a more complete dialouge system. Warning seen bellow. Warning pops up when u load unity after altering/ editing the script.

Also making notes within the scripts and making crappy simplified versions of the tutorial for me to redo and edit in the future on word before I create the tutoial in video , github and or proper docummentation formats, which will just show basic steps and order for the tutorial.
